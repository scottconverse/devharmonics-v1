# DevHarmonics Architecture

Latest tagged release: **v0.6.1**

Architecture snapshot: **unreleased `main` after v0.6.1**

DevHarmonics is a local-first, provider-neutral software factory for product owners managing AI agents as development teams. Its current architecture is a local orchestration layer over official subscription-authenticated coding-agent CLIs. It does not proxy provider HTTP APIs.

## Components

Selected components — the modules that carry the architecture's load-bearing decisions. Files not listed here (types, schemas, prompts, small helpers) support these.

- `src/cli.ts`: command entry point for `serve`, `init`, `doctor`, and `run`.
- `src/server.ts`: loopback-only HTTP server and static dashboard delivery.
- `src/delivery.ts`: READY-run delivery service — separately approved exact-SHA branch pushes, draft GitHub pull requests, gated pull-request merges, and release tags; every external action requires its own owner approval.
- `src/workflows.ts`: versioned parameterized workflow documents — fail-closed parsing, canonical-JSON content-hash identity, and typed instantiation into ordinary objectives.
- `src/doctor.ts`: provider installation and authentication inspection.
- `src/providers.ts`: provider-specific process adapters and credential stripping.
- `src/runtime.ts`: transport-neutral connection, model-selection, invocation, event, result, usage, and classified-failure contracts.
- `src/domain.ts`: provider-neutral identifiers, lifecycle state machines, event contracts, and policy records.
- `src/compatibility.ts`: lossless projections from v0.1 provider fields to stable connection/model identities.
- `src/orchestrator.ts`: planning, dependency scheduling, retries, integration, review, and cancellation.
- `src/catalog.ts`, `src/qualification.ts`, and `src/model-fingerprint.ts`: discovery freshness, exact-model invocation qualification, and stale-evidence detection.
- `src/model-intelligence.ts`, `src/model-performance.ts`, and `src/routing.ts`: task complexity, model tiers, empirical observations with uncertainty gates, replayable score decomposition, adaptive selection, health exclusions, and fallback decisions.
- `src/ollama.ts` and `src/openrouter.ts`: qualified read-only local inference and governed opt-in API inference.
- `src/worktrees.ts` and `src/integration-sets.ts`: repository-local integration/task worktrees plus exact multi-repository integration-set coordination.
- `src/validators.ts`: execution of user-configured validator allowlists.
- `src/verification-integrity.ts`: deterministic integration-diff analysis for weakened verification — deleted/skipped/focused tests, weakened assertions, unconditional success, swallowed errors.
- `src/policy.ts` and `src/local-tools.ts`: tool trust/side-effect policy receipts and the scoped local-model tool loop.
- `src/repository-intelligence.ts`: non-mutating local Git identity, branch, remote, dirty-state, and compatibility inspection.
- `src/product-intelligence.ts`: bounded canonical-source scanning, exact revision/hash provenance, explicit subject-aware claim extraction, and contradiction/missing-source analysis.
- `src/ledger.ts`: SQLite-backed Workbench discussions, objective drafts, immutable plan revisions, source-backed product-intelligence snapshots, approved run linkage, exact integration-set state, and run/task/attempt/check/event receipts.
- `src/reporter.ts`: immutable evidence export, including exact per-repository integration-set commits and status.
- `src/redaction.ts`: centralized secret scrubbing before data crosses the ledger or UI-error boundary.
- `src/ui/`: dependency-free browser interface.

## Trust boundaries

Provider authentication is outside DevHarmonics. Provider prompts and project content cross into the selected provider process. Model output is untrusted: plans are schema-validated, task dependencies are checked, and requested validators must already exist in local configuration.

Connection diagnostics retain separate configuration, installation, authentication, account-visibility, model-entitlement, control-plane-health, capacity, and assignment-availability layers. Subscription model entitlement and remaining quota stay `unknown` until supported discovery or classified execution evidence exists; a successful login is not presented as proof of either.

Run and task lifecycle changes pass through validated state machines before persistence. Legacy `codex`, `claude`, and `gemini` task assignments are projected into stable subscription-CLI connection IDs and explicit unresolved provider-default model IDs. This preserves v0.1 receipts without pretending the old ledger captured a concrete model that it did not record.

The orchestrator invokes every current provider through the same `RuntimeAdapter` contract. Codex, Claude Code, and Antigravity are subscription-CLI transports; Ollama is local; and OpenRouter is an OAuth-backed, explicitly funded API transport. ACP remains contract-defined future work. Antigravity is modeled as one subscription connection whose catalog may contain Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI models. Its model vendor is not inferred from the connection's legacy `gemini` configuration key, and its **Gemini Models** and **Claude and GPT Models** capacity pools have independent health and cooldown state.

Invocation receipts normalize connection identity, requested model, runtime-verified resolved model when available, permissions, output, duration, usage when available, tool requests, lifecycle events, cost, fallback reason, and failure classification. Worker-attempt rows persist the stable connection ID, resolved or unresolved model ID, resolution status, model settings, DevHarmonics adapter version, detected CLI/runtime version, and classified failure kind. Passing an exact model argument does not by itself prove which model executed; when the runtime does not report that identity, the receipt retains the request and marks resolution unverified. Exact model/settings requests are sent only through adapters that implement and qualify them; unsupported controls fail as incompatible rather than being silently ignored.

Each run persists an autonomy mode. Observe planning is fail-closed: every task must be diagnostic, read-only, and low risk. Read-only worker output must be substantive, cannot defer back to an already-completed approval gate, and must contain path/line evidence when the task contract requires it. Only accepted findings enter the run blackboard and final review.

Every concrete routing decision retains its individual score sources rather than only a total. The dashboard replays those sources as **Why this model** evidence, including workload tier, qualification, pins, established reliability and latency, relative catalog price among comparable paid candidates, and provider independence for review. Attempt receipts are aggregated by exact model and workload class across completion, first-pass success, retries, latency, billed cost, malformed envelopes, classified failures, validator failures, and attempt-linked integration conflicts. Run-level NOT READY participation is displayed as non-causal evidence and cannot penalize a model without task-linked findings. Profiles below 5 observations are insufficient, 5–19 are emerging, and 20 or more are established; only established workload slices may alter reliability or latency routing. Users can advance an observation baseline or exclude empirical history without deleting the ledger evidence.

Workers can edit only within their assigned worktrees using the selected CLI's restricted editing mode. Architect and reviewer calls are read-only. Git and configured validators remain local trusted executables.

## Persistence

Each target project receives `.devharmonics/config.json`, `.devharmonics/constitution.md`, and `.devharmonics/devharmonics.db`. Temporary worktrees live below the operating system's temporary directory under `devharmonics/<run-id>`.

Objective planning is a durable pre-run control plane. Saving or updating a structured objective creates no run. Each architect proposal is appended as an immutable numbered plan revision with its human or system rationale. Approval marks one exact revision and a linked run copies that plan into its own ledger projection; the orchestrator skips architecture planning and executes the approved graph. This keeps restarts and later evidence tied to what the user actually authorized rather than an in-memory callback or a silently regenerated plan.

Workbench is a separate read-only consultation plane. A durable session contains ordered user questions and attributed model responses, but it has no run or tool-execution linkage. Each assistant response records the provider connection, requested and resolved model, terminal status, error, token usage, cost, and duration. The only transition out of Workbench is an explicit conversion that creates and links an objective draft; it does not create a plan or run. Runtime invocations use exact active, current-qualified models with `read_only` permission, and paid API models remain subject to the project's explicit spending policy.

The product registry preserves repository boundaries rather than treating a product as a monorepo. Each repository can retain a local path, functional role, expected branch, owners, dependency repository IDs, validator definitions, and governance sources/rules. A separate inspection projection records the observed branch, HEAD, origin, dirty flag, compatibility issues, and check time. Inspection uses only read-only Git and filesystem operations; registration and rescan do not create a run, checkout a branch, fetch, reset, stash, or modify files. Remote-only observations migrate forward with neutral defaults until a local checkout is explicitly attached.

Configured governance sources also serve as canonical product-intelligence sources: governance, architecture, compatibility, version, status, maturity, installer, and release files that the user explicitly chooses. A scan resolves every path inside its registered Git root, rejects traversal and symlink escapes, reads only bounded regular text files, and records the repository HEAD, tracked blob identity when available, SHA-256 content hash, and whether the evidence is uncommitted. Claim extraction is deliberately narrow and subject-aware. Repository/package versions may differ legitimately; a conflict exists only when canonical sources assign different values to the same subject and claim kind. Git tags are not read as product claims. Ledger schema 22 stores every snapshot immutably, and planning receives the latest relevant bounded findings and citations instead of raw file dumps.

An objective may reference one product and an explicit set of its repositories. Before the architect invocation, the orchestrator assembles read-only registry context for the selected repositories, their dependencies and dependents, and relevant umbrella, shared-platform, documentation, installer, and release-truth repositories. The validated plan records each considered repository as affected or excluded with rationale, scopes every task to affected repository IDs, and requires explicit integration conditions whenever several repositories are affected. This analysis remains a pre-run control-plane operation.

The DH-720 execution path accepts a multi-repository plan only when every affected repository has a compatible local checkout, every task targets exactly one affected repository, and integration conditions are explicit. `IntegrationSetManager` preflights the Git roots, rejects duplicate roots, and creates a separate `WorktreeManager` per repository. Each manager pins a base commit, creates a repository-specific integration branch/worktree, creates task branches/worktrees, and serializes merges targeting that repository; schedulable tasks targeting different repositories can run concurrently. Each repository loads its own constitution and validator map. Repository-local validators and verification-integrity checks run before the risk-configured review quorum receives aggregate repository-prefixed diff chunks. Reviewer routing enforces the configured reviewer count, provider diversity, and implementor independence. Blocking findings are assigned only when their location has an exact repository-ID prefix; unscoped findings fail closed. Repository-specific fixer tasks run in the affected integration worktrees, the changed repositories are revalidated, the prior review receipts are retained but invalidated against a new evidence hash, and a fresh quorum is mandatory. Ledger schema 21 retains the exact base and integration HEAD commits, branch/worktree paths, status, errors, integration conditions, fixer tasks, and review receipts; schema 24 binds every current review receipt to hashes of the exact plan, check evidence, task reports, diff, and repository base/HEAD set. Schema 25 atomically reserves paid OpenRouter spend in the shared ledger across CLI and dashboard processes. Schema 26 adds durable reserved/invoked lifecycle state and binds each cost receipt to its reservation: expired reservations known not to have invoked are reclaimable, the final bound receipt settles atomically, and invoked requests without complete receipts remain conservatively reserved. Unknown pricing is rejected, and every accepted request carries a hard completion-token ceiling used to calculate the reserved maximum. The API, evidence export, and run UI project that record. No operation checks out or merges into a registered primary checkout.

This path deliberately fails closed outside that topology. It does not reconstruct interrupted integration sets, clean worktrees automatically, push branches, open pull requests, or allow one task to mutate several repositories. A blocking finding without one exact repository prefix is not guessed or repaired automatically; the run remains `NOT READY` for explicit disposition.

The ledger uses ordered, transactional schema migrations tracked by SQLite's `user_version` and a `schema_migrations` table. Before upgrading an existing schema, DevHarmonics creates a consistent SQLite backup beside the ledger using the filename pattern `devharmonics.db.backup-v<from>-to-v<to>-<timestamp>-<id>.sqlite`. It validates the required table shape, SQLite integrity, foreign keys, and migration history before accepting the upgraded database. Failed migrations roll back and retain the pre-migration backup; databases from newer DevHarmonics schema versions are rejected instead of being modified.

Provider connections and models have normalized registry tables separate from legacy task/provider fields. Dashboard bootstrap and run preflight upsert the three subscription connections without creating concrete model records. Manual model entries require an existing connection, retain provenance and lifecycle flags, enforce visible/verified/qualified/active consistency at the API boundary, and cannot overwrite discovery-managed records. Registry metadata is redacted before persistence.

Ollama discovery registers installed local models without credentials. A local model must pass current, exact-fingerprint qualifications before it can be scheduled. Read-only local review remains context-injected: DevHarmonics supplies bounded per-file diff chunks or independent accepted diagnostic-report chunks with bounded goal, task-contract, and check context. Bounded local implementation uses an orchestrator-managed loop exposing only scoped `file.read`, `file.search`, and hash-checked `file.patch`; the model cannot escape its worktree or repository scope and never receives unrestricted shell, commit, merge, or external-write authority. DevHarmonics records each tool execution and completed review chunk and fails closed on missing, contradictory, deferred, or `NOT READY` evidence. A classified failure cools the exact model or connection and reroutes to the next eligible qualified candidate.

Mellum2 has an explicit local specialist profile. Instruct (`mellum2-instruct`) and Thinking (`mellum2-thinking`) are distinct tracking families so an upgrade cannot silently change the reasoning contract. Both expose code, tool, structured-output, routing, and context-preparation capabilities; Thinking additionally exposes reasoning. Published metadata is only provisional routing evidence: scheduling also requires the appropriate analysis or bounded-tool qualification plus a current `local-specialist-v2` benchmark that verifies strict JSON, contradiction detection, and requirement counting without exposing the accepted answer. Discovery never downloads or activates either variant.

Catalog reconciliation is a separate control plane from model invocation. Launch, periodic, manual, and pre-run refreshes update provider/runtime observations; they do not spend tokens. Fingerprints join exact model metadata to CLI/runtime, adapter, and qualification-suite versions. A fingerprint change makes qualification stale. Three consecutive missing observations are required before retirement.

The adaptive scheduler qualifies only the concrete candidate it is about to use. It independently selects an exact model for architect, worker, and reviewer roles; applies task-tier and capability fit; honors explicit assignments and pins; records the qualification decision; activates successful subscription/local candidates; and cools failed candidates before fallback. Antigravity quota failures cool the reported Gemini or Claude/GPT group until its reset rather than the entire connection, leaving the other group eligible. Provider catalogs suppress unresolved provider-default execution once concrete choices are known. Family-tracked upgrades remain separately gated by exact-model qualification plus the deterministic benchmark. OpenRouter is never automatically probed because paid qualification requires explicit cost confirmation.

Worker invocation timeouts are workload-aware for read-only work: simple diagnostics are bounded at three minutes, standard analysis at ten, and complex analysis at fifteen, always respecting a shorter provider-configured timeout. A timeout enters the same classified model/connection cooldown and retry path as other runtime failures. Workspace-write tasks retain the provider timeout because their legitimate execution window can be substantially longer.

Claude candidates are watched from Anthropic's official models overview because Claude Code does not expose a complete models command. Third-party trackers are advisory only. An exact Claude Code invocation is the entitlement proof for the signed-in subscription.

OpenRouter is an API transport with OAuth-backed, OS-protected credential storage. Its full public catalog is retained separately from the schedulable model registry so hundreds of models are never probed. Only user-imported models can be qualified. Paid execution requires three independent policy gates and two budget caps; the adapter always requests one exact model and sets provider fallback off. Provider, requested/resolved model, tokens, cost, and fallback reason are normalized into invocation receipts.

Events are typed, append-only ledger records. Their monotonic SQLite IDs are durable cursors; `GET /api/runs/<run-id>/events?after=<cursor>&limit=<n>` replays one run oldest-first and returns `nextCursor`. The dashboard uses `GET /api/events` as a persisted server-sent event stream, stores its last cursor for refresh/reconnection, ignores duplicate delivery, and fetches a fresh run projection only after a new durable event. The local server polls SQLite behind the stream; closing or reconnecting a browser never controls run execution.

Since v0.6, DevHarmonics persists immutable reviewed delivery coordinates in the ledger (schema 33 at v0.6.0; schema 34 as of v0.6.1, which adds the persisted merge-commit OID) and include them in evidence package version 6. A READY transition captures the final base branch, base commit, reviewed HEAD, and delivery branch. The loopback dashboard issues a fresh external-write approval for exactly one action at a time: push that exact SHA to its GitHub delivery branch, create a draft pull request, merge the pull request, or tag the release; a composite complete-delivery flow runs the remaining steps but still mints one approval per action. Merging verifies the live pull-request state and refuses conflicts, pending or failing status checks, and a head commit that is no longer the reviewed commit; tagging targets the actual merge commit, persists the applied tag, and recovers an interrupted tag push by reusing the local tag. Completed steps reconcile idempotently, and concurrent operations on one repository are serialized server-side. All actions use typed policy receipts, revalidate the live origin, and retain the result. There is no automatic merge or tag — every external action requires its own owner approval.

DH-647 adds a durable, append-only decision-record ledger (schema 36, `decision_records`) so a rejected approach is never re-proposed from scratch as if it were fresh analysis. A record holds a subject, question, every option considered (selected/rejected with a required reason on every rejected option), the deciding constraint, evidence relied on, and the accepted cost; it is scoped to a run, a product, or the machine, and sourced from either the owner (via the dashboard's Decisions panel) or the architect (recorded automatically when the owner approves a plan whose task decomposition names consequential choices). A changed mind is never a mutation — the owner or architect records a NEW record that supersedes the old one with a required `whatChanged` note, and the original stays exactly as recorded; `getDecisionChain` walks the resulting trail both ways, oldest first. Schema 37 makes both remaining invariants storage-level rather than merely conventional: `BEFORE UPDATE`/`BEFORE DELETE` triggers make a record's content physically immutable, a partial unique index on non-null `supersedes` makes a forked chain (two successors to one record) impossible, and a partial unique index over `(objective_id, plan_revision, decision_ordinal)` makes re-approving the same plan revision, a duplicate start click, or recovery-run replanning physically unable to persist the same architect decision twice. Architect planning is given the top-matching prior decisions for the objective's repositories, each rendered verbatim inside its own explicit untrusted-data delimiters with an instruction that the enclosed text is quoted historical evidence only, never instructions to follow — a defense against a stored record's free text impersonating a later prompt section. Every decision record linked to a run (run-ID match), current and superseded alike, is retained in that run's `decisions` array in evidence package version 6, so evidence never silently drops a record's history just because a later record superseded it.

Reusable workflows (`src/workflows.ts`) are versioned parameterized documents stored in the repository's tracked `workflows/` directory and recorded in the ledger by canonical-JSON content hash. Parsing fails closed: ungated external-write permissions, duplicate input names, outcome-template placeholders that name no declared input, and empty evidence requirements are refused with named issues. Instantiation validates typed inputs (an empty or whitespace-only string does not satisfy a required input) and produces an ordinary objective through the existing composer path — there is no second execution engine. The objective carries the workflow revision hash as structural provenance; starting it pins that hash into the run record once, immutably, derived server-side from the stored objective rather than from any client-supplied value, and hand-editing an objective clears its provenance. Recording a revision as a promotion of an earlier pilot refuses permission widening: external writes switching on, autonomy escalation, or removal of an approval point the pilot required. The public objective routes reject any client-supplied provenance value outright, and the orchestrator verifies and records the pin before execution launches — a run never starts and acquires its pedigree afterwards, and a recovery run keeps the pin of the run it resumes. The shipped workflows-of-record are seeded idempotently at server start from the install's own `workflows/` directory. A workflow's approval points, evidence requirements, and completion contract are advisory metadata in v0.6 — parse-checked, promotion-compared, and carried as policy notes — while runtime gating remains the global run and review policies; structural per-workflow enforcement is deferred.

On a controlled server shutdown, the orchestrator pauses and aborts active runs, waits for their background execution to settle, and only then closes the SQLite ledger. Startup reconciliation remains the recovery path after an uncontrolled process or machine termination.

Prompts, provider output, validator stdout/stderr, errors, reviews, event messages, and event payloads are redacted before persistence. Migration backups are byte-consistent snapshots of pre-existing data, so a backup may contain sensitive values written by an older version and must be protected like the original ledger.

## Deliberate non-features in v0.6.0

- No general API-key configuration; OpenRouter OAuth is the only API transport and paid use remains separately opt-in
- No remote DevHarmonics service
- No automatic merge into the user's checked-out branch
- No automatic Git merge-conflict repair; structured reviewer findings can be fixed and independently re-reviewed
- No external write of any kind without a per-action owner approval; delivery (exact-SHA branch push, draft pull request, gated merge, release tag) is entirely approval-gated. Restart reconstruction, automatic cleanup, and one task spanning several repositories remain unavailable.
- Local Ollama models cannot inspect or write arbitrary repository paths; reviewers receive orchestrator-supplied context, while qualified implementors receive only scoped read/search/hash-checked-patch tools inside the assigned worktree
- Large CPU-only local reviews can be materially slower than subscription reviewers, so capacity-aware background scheduling and stronger local-model profiles remain follow-up work
- No Agent Client Protocol transport yet
